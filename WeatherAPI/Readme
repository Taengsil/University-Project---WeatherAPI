- API Objects: Request/Response object, WeatherForecast object
- API Interface: IWeatherInterface

- WeatherConsole: handles most of the console-printing operations and structuring it;
- WeatherDataUtility: handles reading the data from the JSON object returned by the API;
- WeatherProcessor: handles reading and calling respective methods;
- WeatherService: handles building the API request and calling the OpenWeatherAPI;

Requires an appsettings.json file in the WeatherAPI folder, formatted as such:

{
  "OpenWeatherAPIRequest": {
    "isEnabled": true,
    "weatherAPIUrl": "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=",
    "options": "&units=imperial&appid=",
    "apiKey": ""
  }
}

isEnabled: does not do anything yet, used for turning on/off the API call
weatherAPIUrl: base url to build the request on
options: additional options, always ends in &appid; the code was built with imperial in mind
apiKey: Account-based, each user should get theirs from https://openweathermap.org/api
